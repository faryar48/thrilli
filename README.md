# **[Thrilli](http://thrilli.herokuapp.com)**

## Problem 

No way for adventurous people to find like-minded people. 

## Solution 

Thrilli allows active people in any city to post their next thrill to either just provide a ride in exchange for some gas money or to meet other adventurers in their community.

## Libraries, Gems, and other technologies 

- Ruby on Rails 
- JavaScript
- jQuery 

- Google Maps API 
- Mandrill API 

- carrierwave gem
- Mini Magick gem
- geocoder gem 
- cloudinary gem

## Sore bits 

- using two addresses with Google Maps API  
- styling

## Cool beans 

- getting Google Maps API to work  
- messaging back and forth between adventure poster and attendee

## Next steps 

- gray out/don't show adventures that are full  
- show adventures in your area with geocoder  
- implement date picker (instead of one set date) 
- age limit and dob relationship (i.e. you can't sign up for certain activities unless you are of age) 
- incorporate social media so you can *tweet* or fb your adventure 
- masonry for the front page so it looks prettier 

## Thank you

A big thank you to both Joel Turnbull and Daniel Tsui at General Assembly Sydney for their help and advice throughout the project.
